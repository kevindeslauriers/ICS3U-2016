Zork is a simple, text based adventure game. * * "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is  * connected to at most four other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled * north, east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference * to the neighbouring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction. */import java.util.Set;import java.util.HashMap;import java.util.Iterator;class Room {	private String roomName;    private String description;    private HashMap<String, Room> exits;        // stores exits of this room.    /**     * Create a room described "description".
