Zork is a very *  simple, text based adventure game.  Users can walk around some scenery. *  That's all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting! *  *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" *  routine. *  *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates the *  commands that the parser returns. */class Game {    private Parser parser;    private Room currentRoom;    // This is a MASTER object that contains all of the rooms and is easily accessible.    // The key will be the name of the room -> no spaces (Use all caps and underscore -> Great Room would have a key of GREAT_ROOM    // In a hashmap keys are case sensitive.    // masterRoomMap.get("GREAT_ROOM") will return the Room Object that is the Great Room (assuming you have one).    private HashMap<String, Room> masterRoomMap;        private void initRooms(String fileName) throws Exception{    	masterRoomMap = new HashMap<String, Room>();    	Scanner roomScanner;		try {			HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>> exits = new HashMap<String, HashMap<String, String>>();    			roomScanner = new Scanner(new File(fileName));			while(roomScanner.hasNext()){				Room room = new Room();				// Read the Name				String roomName = roomScanner.nextLine();				room.setRoomName(roomName.split(":")[1].trim());				// Read the Description				String roomDescription = roomScanner.nextLine();				room.setDescription(roomDescription.split(":")[1].replaceAll("<br>", "\n").trim());				// Read the Exits				String roomExits = roomScanner.nextLine();				// An array of strings in the format E-RoomName				String[] rooms = roomExits.split(":")[1].split(",");				HashMap<String, String> temp = new HashMap<String, String>(); 				for (String s : rooms){					temp.put(s.split("-")[0].trim(), s.split("-")[1]);				}								exits.put(roomName.substring(10).trim().toUpperCase().replaceAll(" ",  "_"), temp);								// This puts the room we created (Without the exits in the masterMap)				masterRoomMap.put(roomName.toUpperCase().substring(10).trim().replaceAll(" ",  "_"), room);																// Now we better set the exits.			}						for (String key : masterRoomMap.keySet()){				Room roomTemp = masterRoomMap.get(key);				HashMap<String, String> tempExits = exits.get(key);				for (String s : tempExits.keySet()){					// s = direction					// value is the room.										String roomName2 = tempExits.get(s.trim());					Room exitRoom = masterRoomMap.get(roomName2.toUpperCase().replaceAll(" ", "_"));					roomTemp.setExit(s.trim().charAt(0), exitRoom);									}											}    				roomScanner.close();		} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {			e.printStackTrace();		}    }        /**     * Create the game and initialise its internal map.     */    public Game()     {        try {			initRooms("data/Rooms.dat");			currentRoom = masterRoomMap.get("ROOM_1");		} catch (Exception e) {			// TODO Auto-generated catch block			e.printStackTrace();		}        parser = new Parser();    }        /**     *  Main play routine.
